## Overview

THIS is what working on a slightly bigger project is like? ...Heavens help me. I wanted to die with the itty bitty projects consisting of under 100 lines! I have lost my sanity for much less than this! Have mercy on me, I'm too mentally unstable to cope with anything! 

Anyway, it works. It works! Everything works! If this is a dream please wake me up and tell me I've chosen a completely different carrer.
The HTML and CSS are a bit of a nightmare to read, but I've tried to be as descriptive as I could with everything. The JS started clean enough, but by the end of it madness took over and my DRY approach catapulted itself out the window. 
Is it supposed to look like that, with a hundred and twenty const variables from the DOM? Or am I just doing everything wrong? I like this thrill of mystery.  

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it

## My process

I'm a butterfly, fluttering from mobile to desktop design, from structure to style, from form to functionality. Did being a butterfly benefit me at all? debatable. I feel like making sure that every section works like it should both on mobile and desktop before moving on to the next thing was a good thing, but having to go back to add or modify things when later on I realize something I so beautifully crafted crashes with something I'm beautifully crafting right now made me feel like a parent about to break my child's leg and hoping it could still run somehow. 
 
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS

### What I learned

Patience. I learned I need it.
I learned I vehemently don't have it.

I'm getting oh so slightly oh so slowly better at what questions to ask myself when something doesn't work the way it should. I'm also getting better at getting where I need to be, although the path that takes me there is still unnecessarily convoluted (much like this sentence).
I feel like I've had like a dozen little breakthroughs, or moments when I find out how to use something new, but since it's been DAYS since I've started this and my hair has gotten white and my beard is now long enough to be used as a belt, I don't remember a single one. My little victories are lost forever, and next time I'm fated to waste hours again, before having the same enlightenment I've already had, but sadly forgotten.

### Continued development

I was so proud for how DRY the first part of my code was, but then the last part is just a jumble of wetness. It's dripping incompetence. 
(Wait, is the opposite of dry sweet? like a cocktail? my code's too sweet. my code will give you diabetes and bad teeth.)
I wanted to fix it, but every fiber of my body aches to close this pathetic chapter of my life and move on. Just the thought of spending another minute on it makes me sneeze incontrollably with frustration. It works, let me be happy with it for a moment. I promise I'll fix it eventually.
